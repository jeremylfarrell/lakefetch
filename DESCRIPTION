Description: Calculates fetch (open water distance) and wave exposure metrics
    for lake sampling points. Downloads lake boundaries from OpenStreetMap,
    calculates directional fetch using a ray-casting approach, and optionally
    integrates National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) data
    <https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography> for hydrological context
    including outlet and inlet locations. Can estimate lake depth from surface
    area using empirical relationships, and integrate historical weather data
    for cumulative wave energy calculations. Includes an optional interactive
    Shiny application for visualization.
