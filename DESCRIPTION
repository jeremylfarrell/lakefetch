Title: Calculate Fetch and Wave Exposure for Lake Sampling Points
Version: 0.1.0

    person("Jeremy", "Farrell", email = "farrej2@rpi.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates fetch (open water distance) and wave exposure metrics
    for lake sampling points. Can download lake boundaries from OpenStreetMap,
    calculate directional fetch using a ray-casting approach, and optionally
    integrate National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) data <https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography> for hydrological context,
    including outlet and inlet locations, watershed area, and connectivity
    classification. Can optionally estimate lake depth using the HydroLAKES <https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrolakes>
    database or empirical relationships, and integrate historical weather data
    for cumulative wave energy calculations. Includes an optional interactive
    Shiny application for visualization.
