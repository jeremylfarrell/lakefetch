Title: Calculate Fetch and Wave Exposure for Lake Sampling Points
Version: 0.1.0

    person("Jeremy Lynch", "Farrell", email = "farrej2@rpi.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates fetch (open water distance) and wave exposure metrics
    for lake sampling points. Downloads lake boundaries from OpenStreetMap,
    calculates directional fetch using ray-casting, and optionally integrates
    with NHD (National Hydrography Dataset) for hydrological context including
    outlet/inlet locations, watershed area, and connectivity classification.
    Can estimate lake depth from HydroLAKES database or empirical relationships,
    and integrate historical weather data for cumulative wave energy calculations.
    Includes an interactive Shiny app for visualization.
