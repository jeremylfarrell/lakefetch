}
\value{
Launches a Shiny app (does not return)
}
\description{
Launch a standalone Shiny app where users can upload a CSV file with GPS
coordinates, and the app will automatically download lake boundaries,
calculate fetch, and display interactive results.
}
\details{
Requires the shiny, leaflet, and base64enc packages (suggested dependencies).

The app workflow:
\enumerate{
\item Upload a CSV file with latitude/longitude columns
\item App downloads lake boundaries from OpenStreetMap
\item Calculates fetch for all uploaded points
\item Displays interactive map with results
\item Click anywhere on a lake to analyze additional points
\item Download results as CSV or GeoPackage
}

CSV file requirements:
\itemize{
\item Must have columns starting with "lat" and "lon" (case-insensitive)
\item Optional "Site" column for point names
\item Additional columns are preserved in output
}
}
\examples{
if (interactive()) {
  # Launch the upload app
  fetch_app_upload()
}

}
